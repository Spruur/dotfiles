# Dotfiles

My .files including macos, vim, zsh, git, and tmux configurations. Feel free to use it and even make suggestions, however I may decline if there's not value to me. I'm starting on a fresh page with this repo. My old .files are still available at https://github.com/janesmae/ye_olde_dotfiles/.
