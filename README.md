# Dotfiles

My .files including vim, zsh, git, and tmux configurations. Feel free to use it
and even make suggestions, however I may decline if there's not value to me. 

I'm starting on a fresh page with this repo. My old .files are still available 
at https://github.com/janesmae/ye_olde_dotfiles/.

## Getting started

```sh
$ git clone --recursivees.git ~/.files
```

Run installer

```sh
$ source ~/.files/instal.sh
$ brew bundle install
```
